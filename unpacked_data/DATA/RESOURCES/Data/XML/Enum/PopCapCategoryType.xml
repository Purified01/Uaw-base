   <!-- Certain types do not follow the regular pop cap rules (that is those set by the capacity of the player's containing fleet) so we need to 
   impose other types of pop cap restrictions on those types. With this we can create a collection of 'pop cap buckets' that will determine the
   pop cap rules to be followed by those types associated to each of those buckets.  
   Since this is being added late in the project, right now it will only work for a very specific case (walkers).  However, we will try to
   convert our pop cap tracking system so that this new approach is used for all types.
